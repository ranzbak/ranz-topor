//! Run control for a routing call: cancellation and progress reporting (M4b, Task P1).
//!
//! A [`RunControl`] is shared between the caller (any thread) and the routing run. `cancel` is
//! polled at every deadline check of the engine through [`expired`] / [`cancelled`]: the run then
//! takes the same anytime path as a wall-clock timeout and returns the best result so far with
//! `stop_reason == "cancel"`. `progress` is a snapshot the run overwrites per iteration and per
//! pass.
//!
//! The low-level searches and relaxations receive a plain `Instant` deadline; to keep their
//! signatures the cancel flag of the current run is installed in a thread-local on every thread
//! of the run's private rayon pool ([`install_cancel`]), so concurrent runs in one process never
//! cancel each other.
//!
//! Complexity: [`expired`] and [`cancelled`] are O(1) (one clock read, one thread-local access,
//! one relaxed atomic load); [`RunControl::update`] is O(1) under an uncontended mutex.
